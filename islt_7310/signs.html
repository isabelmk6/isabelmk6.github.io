                    <span style="padding:20px;"> </span>The first element of astrology to learn, and the one many people tend to be familiar with, are astrological signs! Starting with the basics, each sign is associated with a modality, element, and planet, resulting in 12 different “archetypes” with varying characteristics/themes. Before diving in to each sign, let’s first break down the two of the qualities assigned:

            <div>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight:bold;">Modalities</span><br>Modalities are basically different “states” each element can exist in. It can represent the behavioral approach you tend to take. </p>
                
                <p><b>Fixed:</b>

                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p><b>Cardinal:</b>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Love to start new ideas/projects, but often move to another before finishing, the ‘initiator’ modality</li>
                        <li>Very focused on their own goals, can lose sight of others</li>
                        <li>Signs include Libra, Capricorn, Cancer, and Aries</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p><b>Mutable:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Often seek (and find it easy to) change</li>

            </div>

            <div>
                <p>When we put it all together, a sign tells us the personality or energy one may carry, and in what way that personality is shown. For example, Libra and Aquarius are both air signs; they both tend to rely more on intellect than emotion and can be very social. However, an Aquarius may be more likely to stick it out through obstacles, or be stubborn in their views, while a Libra may quickly switch to a new project as well as view. With these concepts in mind, let’s start breaking down each individual sign!</p>
