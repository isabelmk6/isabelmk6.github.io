                <p>When we put it all together, a sign tells us the personality or energy one may carry, and in what way that personality is shown. For example, Libra and Aquarius are both air signs; they both tend to rely more on intellect than emotion and can be very social. However, an Aquarius may be more likely to stick it out through obstacles, or be stubborn in their views, while a Libra may quickly switch to a new project as well as view. With these concepts in mind, let’s start breaking down each individual sign!</p>
