                <span style="padding:20px;"> </span>You’ve probably heard of your sun sign in astrology (the sign linked to the month you were born in), but a lot of people aren’t aware of how much deeper astrology can go! Its roots go as far back as 2,400 BCE. Until the scientific revolution, it was studied as a part of astronomy. When scientists couldn’t fit abstract concepts into the lens of the scientific method, it was dismissed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="padding:20px;"> </span>Despite this, many people still study it, using ancient works as its basis. The purpose of my site is to give you an intro to this complex subject. After reading through, you should be able to understand the basics of birth charts. We’ll also get into houses, astrological signs, and planets. With my easy-to-follow content, you can gain insight about your life and who you are!
