                    <span style="padding-left:20px;"> </span>If we think of the signs as the “how” in our lives, we can think of the planets as the “what”; planets have different functions or roles in different areas of your life and the sign a planet is in can indicate how that area of your life may be expressed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="padding-left:20px;"> </span>It’s important to note that Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are what we call “generational” planets- everyone in your generation will have those planets in the same sign, since they move so slowly. The sign they’re in is less important to you as an individual, but can give insight to common traits among a generation. When considering how those planets affect you individually, it’s more important to look at what house they’re in.

                <p>Now that we’ve gone over signs and planets, we can start looking at a few examples to get a better understanding of how they work together!</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Mercury in Libra:</b> You can recognize this placement in someone who speaks with great diplomacy; they may be able to connect with others easily, charm their way through disagreements, and diffuse tense situations with their communication skills. You’ll often notice these placements struggling with indecision, playing devil’s advocate, and seeking compromise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Mars in Aries: </b>These placements move <i>fast!</i>  They can be quick to anger, and even quicker to move on. They’re able to make decisions quickly based on instinct, using spontaneousness as an asset. They can come off as impatient or blunt, as their nature goes against beating around the bush and they seek a fast pace to keep excitement rolling.
