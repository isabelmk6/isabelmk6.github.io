                    With all of our main elements down, here’s where things get interesting! A birth chart is kind of like a snapshot of the universe at the moment you were born. It’s the combination of a whole bunch of calculations made based on the date, time, and place of your birth, and as you may have guessed, it’s made up of houses, signs, and planets. Astrology gets much more extensive than that, but those are the key pieces to know for an introduction. To create your birth chart, follow this link: <a href="https://www.astro.com/cgi/chart.cgi?rs=2&btyp=w2gw&usechpref=1&" target="_blank">astro.com</a> and enter the required details (try to make sure your birth time is as accurate as possible- it affects what your rising sign is)
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="media/chart_houses.png" alt="image of birth chart with houses circled" height="400">
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Looking at this birth chart as an example, draw your attention to the small circle in the middle where you can see the numbers 1-12 (outlined in a pink circle). These numbers signify your houses! The thick black line above the number 1 is what we refer to as your “ascendant” or rising sign; this position is so important because the sign it’s in determines what sign the rest of your houses will be in. For now, ignore the blue and red lines on the chart. Those represent “aspects” in astrology, but are a more advanced concept for our purposes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    The sign of a house is determined by looking at the first line of a house and seeing what sign it falls in. For example, look at the number 3 on the chart and follow the line to the left of it; it goes into the symbol for capricorn, so we say they have their 3rd house in Capricorn (even though half of the house takes up space in Aquarius). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take notice of the square table to the left of the wheel; the rows represent how many planets you have in a modality, and the columns represent how many in an element. You can determine what your dominant element and modality is based on this table!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="media/chart_sign.png" alt="image of birth chart with house line outlined">
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="media/libra_sun.png" alt="image of birth chart with sun in libra pointed out">
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Next, we want to look at the symbols inside the houses. Some houses may be “empty”, meaning they don’t have symbols of planets in them; these houses are still important, they just won’t have as much energy focused in that area of life as ones that do. There is a table at the bottom of the chart image that tells you what symbol goes with what planet and what sign it’s in. For example, we see that the sun is in Libra in the table- now look for the part of the chart that has libra in it. We see that the symbol for the sun is in the 12th house; putting it all together, we say this person has a Libra sun in 12th house. From there, you can start putting together all of the themes we learned in previous pages!

            <div>
                <p>Let’s use this chart for examples to get an idea of how to interpret a chart.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Libra Sun in 12th house:</b> A person with a libra sun could be very charming, diplomatic, and relational. They could find great pride in creating harmony in their environment, winning debates, and making friends. The sun being in the 12th house tells us this person may feel a need to hide who they really are from others or themselves, and may people-please or focus too much on others to accomplish this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Leo Moon in 10th house:</b> A person with a leo moon may have very strong emotions and be quite passionate. They may internally crave attention and the spotlight, but paradoxically feel uncomfortable when they have it externally. They can be very attentive, loving, and demanding of those they love, expecting the same in return. With the moon in 10th house, this can indicate someone who is a natural leader in the workplace, has a strong desire to be recognized for their success, and gets much emotional fulfillment from their career.

                <p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>
                <p>Astrology can be overwhelming to get into, but hopefully this introduction made things easier to digest! If you've made it this far and want to explore more, here are my biggest tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start out by researching what planets in specific signs mean for you</li>
                        <li>You can google things like "venus in libra" or "venus in 5th house" (replace with planet/sign/house applicable to you)</li>
                        <li>There are tons of websites that give you free chart reports! They can help you figure out how to break down your chart</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
