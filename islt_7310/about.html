                    <span style="padding:20px;"> </span>Hi, my name is Isabel! I’m a senior at Mizzou and I study biomedical engineering with an emphasis in bioinformatics and a certificate in Information Technology. I’m also studying for a cybersecurity certification, which I plan to have by end of summer. In high school, I graduated as valedictorian of my class.  Right now, I work as an information security intern. I hope to stay in the InfoSec field after I graduate in December. <br> <span style="padding:20px;"> </span> In my free time, I do a range of hobbies. I like to joke that the hobby I love best is <em>finding new hobbies</em>. The ones I do most are piano, astrology, and reading. I also spend a lot of time with my rabbit, Mr. Moopy! My <em>favorite</em> saying to live by is:  
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    “Feel the fear and <b> do it anyway</b>”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    It reminds me to step out of my comfort zone and go for what I want!
